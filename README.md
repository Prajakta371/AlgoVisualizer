## 🚀 Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A*  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Perceptron, Approximate Q-Learning, Minimax
  
- Adjustable speed (slow / medium / fast)  
- Adjustable array size for sorting  
- Interactive grid: drag Start & Target nodes, add walls, generate mazes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** (Create React App)  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **CSS3** for styling  
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment

## 🎓 Purpose
This project was built to help **students and learners understand algorithms visually**.  
Instead of just reading theory, users can interact with **Pathfinding, Sorting, and AI algorithms** step by step.  

For me, this project demonstrates:  
- Strong grasp of **data structures & algorithms**  
- Ability to turn concepts into an **interactive React app**  
- Skills in **frontend development, visualization, and deployment**
